                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is an automated payload tester that I helped implement
                    during my internship over the summer. It's job was to be run everytime someone
                    pushed new code to the github respository in order to verify that the new code is correctly
                    compatible with
                    the microcontroller.

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>CprE 288 is our introduction to embedded software class, and really where I began to find my
                    enjoyment
                    for the disciple as a whole. As part of our final project we were tasked with creating a way to
                    remotely control a Roomba utilizing a TIVA microcontroller. Through the use of websockets, we were
                    able to sucessfully remotely control the roomba, as well as create a GUI for the IR and ultrasound
                    sensors. I was able to take my understanding of embedded and register programming, and apply it to
                    complete this project.</p>
